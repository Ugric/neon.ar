# neon.ar

An implimentation of nunjucks, a html rendering library, remade for the argon programming language.

# Bugs and missing features

neon.ar is a designed to be able to use any template made for nunjucks, without any form of modification of the nunjucks template.

**IF IT EXISTS IN NUNJUCKS BUT NOT IN NEON.AR, ITS A BUG!**

Please create an issue if you come across any features which have not been implimentated yet, but please make sure that the issue hasn't already been made by someone else yet.

the goal is to have all features which are found at [https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) implimented, so if you are a developer, please feel free to make a pull request implimenting any features that are not yet added.

# How to use

Because neon.ar is still in development, we are not yet writing any documentation on how to use it yet, since things may change.
